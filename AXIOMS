* Should be as simple as possible for simple things
    * But no simpler!
        * ex: You can use make to build a c file without a Makefile:
            * make ex1.c -> cc ex1.c -o ex1
            * Too specific!
                * right?
        * Q: support environment vars like make?
    * But, it should be simple to build a single C file
    * or copy a directory
    * or checkout something from git, svn, etc
    * or move a file
* Have is a utility belt; it should be *useful* over *pretty*
    * Messy solutions should work; pretty solutions easy to find
