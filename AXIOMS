* Should be as simple as possible for simple things
    * But no simpler!
        * ex: You can use make to build a c file without a Makefile:
            * make ex1.c -> cc ex1.c -o ex1
            * Too specific!
                * right?
        * Q: support environment vars like make?
    * But, it should be simple to build a single C file
    * or copy a directory
    * or checkout something from git, svn, etc
    * or move a file
* pub is a utility belt; it should be *useful* over *pretty*
    * Messy solutions should work; pretty solutions easy to find
* pub will have beautiful documentation of *all* features
    * pub will innovate documentation
* pub should be pythonic
    * I don't believe there's a need to learn a new language just to write makefiles
    * No magic; import things just like a regular python program
* Should wrap the best available libraries
    * path.py https://github.com/dottedmag/path.py
    * envoy https://github.com/kennethreitz/envoy
    * requests https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests
    * clint https://github.com/kennethreitz/clint
    * times https://github.com/nvie/times
    * use rsync for file copies!
