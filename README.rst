pub - the Python Utility Belt

Pub is a tool to help you automate those tasks you don't want to manually. It
attempts to provide the cleanest, sanest interface for your building, cleaning,
and deploying needs.

Pub code is simply python code, allowing you to leverage the skills and tools
you're already familiar with.

Here's an example with two tasks, one to build a project and one to deploy it
to a server:

::

    import pub
    from pub.shortcuts import mkdir, cp, rsync

    @pub.task
    def build():
        mkdir("build")
        cp("src/binary", "build")

    @pub.task("build")
    def deploy():
        rsync("build", "user@server:~")

The pub.shortcuts module gives us handy shortcuts to access command-line
functionality.

The *deploy* task depends on the *build* task, so calling "*pub deploy*"
will first run the build task, then deploy.
