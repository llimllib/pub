pub - the Python Utility Belt

Pub is a tool to help you automate those tasks you don't want to manually. It
attempts to provide the cleanest, sanest interface for your building, cleaning,
and deploying needs.

An example::

    Whitespace, newlines, blank lines, and all kinds of markup
      (like *this* or \this) is preserved by literal blocks.
  Lookie here, I've dropped an indentation level
  (but not far enough)

no more example
